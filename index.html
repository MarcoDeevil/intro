          <h3>PocketPanda</h3>
          <p>2D "clicker game". You feed Panda to get points, you can also play
            mini-games to obtain them. For points you can buy better hat for your Panda.
            There is authentication system built with Firebase and all the game status is being
            saved to the Firebase database, so your progress is saved.

          <h3>SketchyBuildings</h3>
          <p>That's more like a concept of 3D sketched model game. I think the idea and results are
            very interesting and i will sure play with this in the future. It could be first person
            detective style game or maybe more RTS, strategic game with buildings in this style
