          <h3>PocketPanda</h3>
          <p>2D "clicker game". You feed Panda to get points, you can also play
            mini-games to obtain them. For points you can buy better hat for your Panda.

          <h3>SketchyBuildings</h3>
          <p>That's more like a concept of 3D sketched model game. I think the idea and results are
            very interesting and i will sure play with this in the furture. It could be first person
            detective style game or maybe more RTS, strategic game with buildings in this style

          <h3>HardHardHard</h3>
          <p>2D skillful, little rng game with simple mechanic, sometimes addictive.
            Game was made for fun, for friends to compete together. It was made in few hours.
